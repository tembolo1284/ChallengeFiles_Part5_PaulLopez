# Project Title

This is the Financial Planner Application for challenge 5! The first part of the applications pulls in current pricing data
for Bitcoin and Ethereum. I have a theoretical holding of each coin, and I calculate the individual as well as combined
holding values of my crypto currency position.

A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

Youâ€™ll use the information from the Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio in your Jupyter notebook.
